# Who am I?
Hello! I take an interest in many things, such as free and open source software, digital security, privacy, adoption of IPv6, and other stuff from time to time.
Nowadays, I'm more of a user and passive contributor. I contributed to many projects with localization, bug reports, security observations, etc.

## Translation
I translate a lot of free Android software, making many of it accessible to Brazil.

> [!TIP]
> Consider contributing yourself! There's actually *not* enough people for most languages, Brazilian Portuguese which has 205M speakers
> wasn't in a good state, so what about *your* language? You'll also learn more about the software you translate and ignoring that,
> also make the app *easier* to navigate, even for *you*. It may seem pointless, but it helps a lot.
