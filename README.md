# Translation Work

Experimenting with translations *(not a genius or anything)* at the moment, *(but)* it's been nice and I have helped some projects.
I have so far notably contributed to:

  * [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org)
  * [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org)
  * [microG](https://microg.org)
  * [Seedvault](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault)
  * [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)
  * [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com)
  * [DivestOS apps](https://divestos.org/pages/our_apps)
  * ... (more can be found in [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/lucasmz/), [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/lucasmz.dev), and [in my tracker.](https://codeberg.org/lucasmz/translation-suggestions/issues))

## Suggestions

If you want me to look into *translations for a certain project*, can be yours, or someone else's, let me know by creating an issue [here](https://codeberg.org/lucasmz/translation-suggestions/issues).
