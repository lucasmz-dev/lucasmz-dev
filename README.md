# Translation
I translate many FOSS Android apps/OSes to PT-BR, making many of them accessible to Brazilians.

  * [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org)
  * [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org)
  * [microG](https://microg.org)
  * [SeedVault](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault)
  * [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)
  * [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com)
  * [DivestOS](https://divestos.org/pages/our_apps)
  * [NeoStumbler](https://github.com/mjaakko/NeoStumbler)

(and many more [in my tracker.](https://codeberg.org/lucasmz/translation-suggestions/issues))

## Suggestions
If you want me to look into translations for a certain project, yours, or someone else's, let me know by creating an issue [in my tracker](https://codeberg.org/lucasmz/translation-suggestions/issues). I am always looking into new things.

## Getting in touch
* [XMPP](xmpp:lucasmz@conversations.im?omemo-sid-1816914948=79dd479374a1afa3e86e5dcf868443f82256b89229960bac9f27185c74b75e33;omemo-sid-1375863833=77cc064aa195af9802cd4c44b62df8d1b8cca53fc6c548c9252d34b76fd82f3a)
* [Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/Vg5FoFZ1pxkbrlAj71Mhzf6tTCTVVzo64l-EAkPTXAE3c15ulS1P67BByq8p9rrI)
* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@lucasmz:tchncs.de)

*None* of these provide *anonymous* but *do* provide *private* conversations. Matrix and XMPP should be somewhat anonymous when used with Tor. If you need anonymous communication for whatever reason, let me know and we can upgrade to that.
