# Who am I?
Hello! I take an interest in many things, such as AOSP, Linux, security, privacy, IPv6, the FOSS ecosystem, localization, and much more.
I previously contributed to the Roblox OSS community, with things such as [FastSignal](https://github.com/rblxutils/fastsignal).
Nowadays, I'm more of a user and passive contributor. I contributed to many projects with localization, bug reports, security observations, etc.

## Translation
I translate many FOSS Android apps/OSes to PT-BR, making many of them accessible to Brazil, notable examples are:

  * [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org)
  * [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org)
  * [microG](https://microg.org)
  * [Seedvault](https://github.com/seedvault-app/seedvault)
  * [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org)
  * [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com)
  * [NeoStumbler](https://github.com/mjaakko/NeoStumbler)

(and more [in my tracker](https://codeberg.org/lucasmz/translation-suggestions/issues).)

## Getting in touch
* [XMPP](xmpp:lucasmz@conversations.im?omemo-sid-1816914948=79dd479374a1afa3e86e5dcf868443f82256b89229960bac9f27185c74b75e33;omemo-sid-2107531358=915fb36445dc132224e1f2642e4928eacc355b09814214f36efa96f0999a216c)
* [Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/Vg5FoFZ1pxkbrlAj71Mhzf6tTCTVVzo64l-EAkPTXAE3c15ulS1P67BByq8p9rrI)
* [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@lucasmz:catgirl.cloud)

*None* of these provide *anonymous* but *do* provide *private* conversations. Matrix and XMPP should be considerably anonymous when used with Tor. If you need anonymous communication for whatever reason, let me know and we can upgrade to that.
