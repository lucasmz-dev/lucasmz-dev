If you want to donate for any reason, such as supporting a project with translations, here's what I accept:
The donations option here, outside of Pix, are stuck to only be accessible from when I'm 18, as I might not be able to withdraw them into BRL until then.
Monero is something I can use, for one thing or another, like donations to other people. I prefer it, over any others that are added here, except for Pix, really.

# Pix

Pix is a Brazilian payment method. It sends money more directly to me in a way I can actually spend it.
My PIX key is:
```

```

# Monero (XMR)

You can also donate using the private and fungible cryptocurrency Monero. The good thing about it is the security and how it works everywhere and has no issues with location. I do not have wallets in any other cryptocurrencies as I don't see their point and they're really bad as currencies which makes only big donations worth it.
If your Monero wallet client supports OpenAlias, you can simply type my domain, `donations.lucasmz.dev`, into the address bar and send it directly. Otherwise, here's my wallet address:
